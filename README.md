# [Hash](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/Hash.html) Basics

## Goals

After this exercise, a student will be able to:

* Create hashes, and perform simple operations on them
* Add new data to a hash
* Work with nested hashes

## Tech skill learned

* Ruby hashes

## Resources

* Online Materials
* [Hash Docs](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/Hash.html)

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repo
1. Look at the data in `person.rb`
2. 1. Check out `00_example.rb` for an example of what to do (basically, just `puts` things out
  1. Import the tracker stories in `stories.csv` and work through them.

  ## Further Practice
  
  This warmup can be completed multiple times to increase your comfort level with the material.
  To work on this from scratch, you can:

  1. Add an upstream remote that points to the original repo `git remote add upstream git@github.com:gSchool/hash-basics.git`
  1. Fetch the latest from the upstream remote using `git fetch upstream`
  1. Create a new branch from the master branch of the upstream remote `git checkout -b v2 upstream/master`
  1. Implement specs and code
  1. Push using `git push -u origin v2`

  Each time you do the exercise, create a new branch. For example the 3rd time you do the exercise the branch
  name will be v3 instead of v2.
